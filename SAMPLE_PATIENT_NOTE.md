•	Medication Management
 
 
History (HPI): 
Mr. Goss is a 42-year-old married male working in law enforcement who presents for a new patient evaluation. He reports a recent tumultuous period involving significant medical and psychosocial stressors. Several months ago, he was hospitalized for pulmonary emboli and was subsequently diagnosed with functional neurological disorder (FND) after presenting with tremors and an inability to walk or speak, requiring a stay at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. He finds the FND diagnosis distressing due to the lack of objective findings on imaging.
 
This period was compounded by significant marital strain (now improved), financial hardship due to a payroll error, and estrangement from his parents and brother. He endorses a history of trauma related to his career and notes a recent return of PTSD symptoms, including nightmares and significant irritability. He reports his current dose of lisdexamfetamine for ADHD is no longer lasting the full day, and he experiences profound fatigue by early afternoon. He also describes difficulty with sleep initiation due to racing thoughts.
 
During the interview, it was discovered that the patient unintentionally discontinued his clonidine prescription approximately two months ago, which correlates with the worsening of his anxiety, sleep, and PTSD-related symptoms. He also reports a suicide attempt approximately 3-4 months ago during the peak of his distress, where he armed himself with a firearm but aborted the attempt due to thoughts of his children. He denies any current suicidal ideation.

Risk Assessment:
Risk factors: Past suicide attempt, access to lethal means (history of firearm ownership as law enforcement officer), significant financial and interpersonal stressors, chronic medical issues, and job-related trauma.

These factors will be addressed through ongoing medication management, psychotherapy, and safety planning as needed.
 
FORMULATION:
Mr. Goss is a 42-year-old male with a history of PTSD, MDD, and ADHD who presents for medication management after a period of intense medical and psychosocial stress, including a new diagnosis of functional neurological disorder. His primary complaints of worsening irritability, nightmares, poor sleep, and daytime fatigue appear to be significantly correlated with the unintentional discontinuation of clonidine approximately two months ago. His symptoms are causing significant distress and functional impairment. He is insightful into his condition and motivated for treatment, with strong protective factors including his family and engagement in care. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 	 	ICD-10-CM	 
1.	Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate (HCC) 	F33.1	 
 
2.	Posttraumatic stress disorder 	F43.10	 
 
3.	Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder), s/p rehabilitation with mild residual speech and memory deficits 	F44.4	 
 
 
 
PLAN:
 
Lab Orders: none
 
Medication Management: 
- Restart Clonidine 0.1 mg BID. The patient was taking this previously with good effect, and its unintentional discontinuation is the most likely cause of his recent symptom exacerbation. This is expected to help with anxiety, irritability, sleep, and PTSD-related nightmares.
- Continue Duloxetine 60 mg BID for depression and PTSD symptoms.
- Continue Lisdexamfetamine 20 mg daily for ADHD. Considering dose increase if patient continues to have afternoon return of difficulties with concentration and fatigue.
- Discussed the rationale for restarting clonidine, emphasizing its role in managing anxiety and PTSD symptoms, which can rebound upon abrupt discontinuation. Patient verbalized understanding and agreement.
 
Psychotherapy referral: Patient is currently established with a therapist ("Ally") and is encouraged to continue with his sessions.
 
Time spent in the evaluation and management visit: 70 minutes
>50% of time spent in counseling +/- coordination of care.
 
We discussed the benefits and risks of the treatment(s) listed above and the patient verbalized understanding of and agreement with this plan.
 
I performed 20 minutes of psychotherapy with the patient today, using supportive techniques and insight-oriented therapy as well as ACT (particularly acceptance of FND). Therapy was deployed to reduce symptoms of anxiety.
 
Next appointment 6 weeks or sooner if needed.

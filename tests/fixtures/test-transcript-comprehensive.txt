[TRANSCRIPT START]

Dr. Sweeney: Good morning, Jeremy. I'm Dr. Sweeney. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you to see me?

Jeremy: Hi doctor. Well, I've been struggling for a while now. My primary care doctor, Dr. Thompson, suggested I come see a psychiatrist. I've been feeling really depressed and anxious for the past four months, and it's getting worse.

Dr. Sweeney: I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. Can you tell me more about when this started and what you've been experiencing?

Jeremy: It started around July, right after I lost my job as a software engineer at TechCorp. I'd been there for eight years. They had layoffs, and even though they said it wasn't personal, I can't help but feel like it was my fault. Since then, I just feel hopeless, like "what's the point?" you know? I wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning and can't get back to sleep. I lie there thinking about all the things I did wrong.

Dr. Sweeney: That sounds really difficult. How has your mood been during the day?

Jeremy: Terrible. I'd say my mood is like a 3 out of 10 most days. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I used to love hiking and playing guitar, but I haven't touched my guitar in months. My wife says I'm irritable all the time, and she's right. Little things set me off. Yesterday I yelled at our 12-year-old son just for leaving his backpack on the couch. That's not like me.

Dr. Sweeney: How about your energy and concentration?

Jeremy: Energy is basically zero. It takes everything I have just to shower and get dressed. I've been applying for jobs, but I can't focus long enough to finish applications. I read the same paragraph over and over. My wife has been handling all the bills because I just can't deal with it.

Dr. Sweeney: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?

Jeremy: I'll be honest - yes. I haven't made any plans or anything, but sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me. I think about driving off the road sometimes, but I would never actually do it. I have kids who need me. But the thoughts are there.

Dr. Sweeney: I appreciate you being open about that. It's important we address these thoughts. Have you ever attempted suicide in the past?

Jeremy: No, never. Never attempted. I've never even really come close. These thoughts are new for me, and they scare me.

Dr. Sweeney: Have you ever hurt yourself in other ways, like cutting?

Jeremy: No, nothing like that. Never.

Dr. Sweeney: Let me ask about your psychiatric history. Have you been diagnosed with any mental health conditions before?

Jeremy: Yes, back in 2018, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder by Dr. Sarah Chen at Valley Mental Health. Then in 2020, another psychiatrist, Dr. Johnson, also diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Dr. Sweeney: What treatments have you tried?

Jeremy: I was on sertraline, starting at 50mg and went up to 200mg, from 2018 to 2019. It helped somewhat but I had sexual side effects that were problematic. Then I tried venlafaxine XR at 150mg from 2019 to 2020, which worked better but I developed high blood pressure so we had to stop. I've been taking quetiapine 50mg at bedtime since 2020 just for sleep.

Dr. Sweeney: Any psychiatric hospitalizations?

Jeremy: No, never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons.

Dr. Sweeney: What about therapy?

Jeremy: Yes, I did CBT with Dr. Johnson from 2019 to 2020, about six months of weekly sessions. It was helpful. Then I did a DBT group at Valley in 2020 for about three months, focusing on distress tolerance skills.

Dr. Sweeney: Let's go through some other symptoms. How's your sleep been?

Jeremy: Terrible. I fall asleep okay around 11pm, but I wake up at 3 or 4am and can't get back to sleep. Maybe get 4-5 hours total.

Dr. Sweeney: Appetite?

Jeremy: Decreased. I've lost about 15 pounds in the past three months without trying. Food just doesn't appeal to me.

Dr. Sweeney: Any anxiety or panic attacks?

Jeremy: Constant anxiety, especially about finances and finding a job. I get panic attacks maybe twice a week - heart racing, sweating, feeling like I can't breathe, lasting about 10-15 minutes.

Dr. Sweeney: Any manic or hypomanic episodes - times of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, feeling grandiose?

Jeremy: No, nothing like that. I wish I had more energy, but no, never had anything like mania.

Dr. Sweeney: Any hallucinations - seeing or hearing things others don't?

Jeremy: No, nothing like that.

Dr. Sweeney: Paranoid thoughts?

Jeremy: No, not paranoid.

Dr. Sweeney: Any obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors?

Jeremy: Not really. I mean, I ruminate a lot about losing my job, but no real OCD symptoms.

Dr. Sweeney: Any flashbacks or nightmares from traumatic events?

Jeremy: I have occasional nightmares about work situations, but not PTSD-type flashbacks.

Dr. Sweeney: How about attention and focus issues since childhood?

Jeremy: No, concentration problems are new since the depression started. I was always a good student.

Dr. Sweeney: Any thoughts of harming others?

Jeremy: No, absolutely not. Never.

Dr. Sweeney: Let's talk about substances. Do you drink alcohol?

Jeremy: Socially, maybe 2-3 beers on weekends. No history of problems with alcohol, no DUIs, no withdrawal symptoms.

Dr. Sweeney: Cannabis?

Jeremy: I tried it in college but not in the past 10 years.

Dr. Sweeney: Tobacco or nicotine?

Jeremy: I used to smoke, pack a day for about 10 years, but I quit 5 years ago. I occasionally use nicotine gum when stressed.

Dr. Sweeney: Any stimulants like cocaine or amphetamines?

Jeremy: I take Adderall XR 20mg daily for the past two years, prescribed by my PCP for focus issues. Never used cocaine or street amphetamines.

Dr. Sweeney: Opioids?

Jeremy: No, never.

Dr. Sweeney: Benzodiazepines?

Jeremy: I had a prescription for lorazepam as needed a few years ago but stopped because I was worried about dependence. Haven't taken any in over a year.

Dr. Sweeney: Any other substances?

Jeremy: No, nothing else.

Dr. Sweeney: Any substance abuse treatment?

Jeremy: No, never needed it. Quit smoking on my own with nicotine replacement.

Dr. Sweeney: Tell me about your living situation.

Jeremy: I live in a house with my wife Maria and our two kids - our son is 12 and daughter is 8. We're stable housing-wise, own our home, but financially stressed since I lost my job.

Dr. Sweeney: Employment status?

Jeremy: Unemployed for 4 months now. I worked as a senior software engineer at TechCorp for 8 years before the layoffs.

Dr. Sweeney: Education?

Jeremy: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from State University, graduated 2010.

Dr. Sweeney: How's your relationship with your wife?

Jeremy: Strained right now because of my mood and the financial stress, but she's supportive. We've been married 14 years. The kids and I have a good relationship usually, though I've been more irritable lately.

Dr. Sweeney: Support system?

Jeremy: Pretty good. My wife is supportive, my sister lives nearby and we're close. I have two good friends from college I can talk to. My parents live about an hour away and they're helpful.

Dr. Sweeney: Financial situation?

Jeremy: Stressful. Lost my primary income. My wife works part-time as a teacher. We're using savings and I've applied for unemployment benefits.

Dr. Sweeney: Any legal issues?

Jeremy: No, never had any legal problems. No arrests, no DUIs, nothing like that.

Dr. Sweeney: Any history of trauma?

Jeremy: I witnessed my parents arguing a lot when I was a kid, some domestic violence between them, but I was never physically or sexually abused. I was in a car accident three years ago that shook me up for a while, but I got over it.

Dr. Sweeney: Military service?

Jeremy: No, never served.

Dr. Sweeney: Family psychiatric history?

Jeremy: My mother has depression and takes medication for it. My maternal grandmother had depression too. My father has issues with alcohol but won't admit it. My younger sister has anxiety.

Dr. Sweeney: Okay, let me observe and document a few things. You appear well-groomed, appropriately dressed. You've been cooperative throughout our interview, maintaining good eye contact. Your speech is normal rate and volume. You described your mood as depressed, and I can see your affect is congruent with that - somewhat restricted. Your thought process seems linear and goal-directed. No evidence of psychosis. You mentioned passive suicidal ideation without plan or intent. Your insight and judgment appear intact. Is that accurate?

Jeremy: Yes, that sounds right.

Dr. Sweeney: Alright Jeremy, based on everything you've told me, your diagnosis is most consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate severity. You meet the criteria - depressed mood, loss of interest, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite with weight loss, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, and passive suicidal ideation. You also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Jeremy: That makes sense.

Dr. Sweeney: My plan is to restart medication since you had partial response before. I want to start you on sertraline again, but we'll go slower this time - 50mg daily and see how you tolerate it. We can adjust from there. Continue the quetiapine for sleep. I'm also going to refer you to one of our therapists for CBT focused on depression and return-to-work issues. I think weekly therapy would be helpful initially.

Jeremy: Okay, that sounds good.

Dr. Sweeney: I provided supportive therapy today, validating your experience with job loss and helping you understand depression as a medical condition, not a personal failure. We discussed coping strategies and the importance of treatment adherence. This session was about 30 minutes of therapy.

Jeremy: Thank you, I appreciate that.

Dr. Sweeney: I'd like to see you back in 2 weeks to see how you're doing with the medication. We can do it via telehealth if that's easier. Or sooner if you need to. Does that work?

Jeremy: Yes, 2 weeks sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Sweeney.

Dr. Sweeney: You're welcome. Remember, if those suicidal thoughts get worse or you develop any plans, please call our crisis line or go to the emergency room immediately. Take care.

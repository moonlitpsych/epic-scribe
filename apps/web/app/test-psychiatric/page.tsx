Doctor: Good morning, how have you been since our last visit?

Patient: Not great, honestly. I've been feeling really down for the past month, maybe even longer. It's been getting worse.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about what you mean by feeling down?

Patient: I just have no energy, no motivation. I used to love playing guitar and going hiking with my kids, but I haven't done either in weeks. Nothing feels enjoyable anymore.

Doctor: How's your sleep been?

Patient: Terrible. I fall asleep okay around 10 PM, but I wake up at 3 or 4 AM and can't get back to sleep. I just lie there with my mind racing about everything that's wrong.

Doctor: And your appetite?

Patient: I've lost about 15 pounds in the last two months. Food just doesn't appeal to me. My wife keeps trying to get me to eat, but I'm just not hungry.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?

Patient: I've had some passive thoughts, like wondering if everyone would be better off without me, but I would never actually do anything. I have my kids to think about.

Doctor: Have you ever been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons?

Patient: Yes, once back in 2018. I was at University Hospital for about a week for severe depression. That's when they started me on sertraline.

Doctor: Any history of suicide attempts?

Patient: No, never. Even when things were really bad in 2018, I never attempted anything.

Doctor: Do you drink alcohol or use any substances?

Patient: I have a couple beers on the weekends, nothing excessive. I don't use any drugs. I used to smoke cigarettes but quit 5 years ago.

Doctor: Tell me about your living situation and support system.

Patient: I live with my wife and two kids, ages 8 and 12. My wife is very supportive, but I can tell this is wearing on her. I was working as a software engineer but got laid off 2 months ago, which has made everything worse.

Doctor: Any trauma or difficult experiences in your past?

Patient: My parents divorced when I was young, and there was a lot of fighting. But nothing too traumatic, no abuse or anything like that.

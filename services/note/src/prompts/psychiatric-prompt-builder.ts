TASK: Generate a psychiatric note using the provided template, following section-specific instructions precisely.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. SmartLinks: Convert ALL @identifier@ to .identifier (e.g., @FNAME@ â†’ .FNAME)
2. SmartLists: Output ONLY the selected value text, not the {Display:ID} wrapper
3. Wildcards: Replace *** with relevant transcript content, or leave *** if not discussed
4. Format: Use paragraphs only - NO bullets, NO numbered lists except where specified in Plan
5. Accuracy: Do not invent information not in the transcript

SMARTLIST DEFINITIONS:
${smartListDefinitions}

TEMPLATE SECTIONS:

GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Process each section according to its specific instructions and temperature setting
2. For HPI: Generate detailed narrative (temperature 0.7) - do NOT over-condense
3. For Psychiatric History: Extract facts precisely (temperature 0.3)
4. For ROS and MSE: Select SmartList options carefully (temperature 0.2)
5. For Formulation: Follow exact 4-paragraph structure (temperature 0.5)
6. For Plan: Use exact formatting with subsections (temperature 0.3)

OUTPUT: Generate the complete note following the template structure. Do not include any meta-commentary or section headers beyond what's in the template.`;

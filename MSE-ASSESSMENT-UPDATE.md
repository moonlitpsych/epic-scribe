# Mental Status Exam & Assessment Updates

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready to test

## Changes Applied

### 1. Mental Status Examination - Structured Format ✅

**Problem:** MSE was output as a single paragraph narrative.

**Solution:** Changed template to use structured line-by-line format matching Epic RCC Intake standard.

**Before (Paragraph):**
```
Mental Status Examination

The patient appears their stated age, casually dressed with adequate hygiene. They are cooperative and maintain good eye contact. Speech is normal in rate and tone...
```

**After (Structured):**
```
Mental Status Examination

Appearance: Well-groomed, appropriate dress, appears stated age
Behavior: Cooperative, calm
Eye Contact: Good
Speech: Normal rate and tone
Mood: "Depressed"
Affect: Congruent with mood, restricted range
Thought Process: Linear and goal-directed
Thought Content: No delusions, no paranoid ideation
Perceptual Disturbances: None reported
Suicidal Ideation: Denies
Homicidal Ideation: Denies
Insight: Fair - understands need for treatment
Judgment: Fair - appropriate decision-making observed
```

### 2. Assessment - Added Formulation Section ✅

**Problem:** Assessment section only had diagnosis and SmartLists, no clinical formulation.

**Solution:** Added "Formulation" subsection with comprehensive exemplar.

**Before:**
```
Assessment

@DIAGNOSIS@
Risk assessment: {Risk Level}
Prognosis: {Prognosis}
```

**After:**
```
Assessment

Diagnostic Impression: Major Depressive Disorder, moderate severity (F32.1); Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)

Formulation: This is a 35-year-old patient presenting with a 3-month history of depressed mood, anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite consistent with a major depressive episode. Symptoms appear to have been triggered by significant work-related stress and have progressively worsened. The patient has limited social support and has not previously engaged in mental health treatment. Anxiety symptoms are also prominent and appear to predate the depressive episode. The patient demonstrates fair insight into their condition and motivation for treatment. Protective factors include stable employment, no substance use, and willingness to engage in both medication and therapy.

Risk assessment: Low
Prognosis: Good with treatment
```

## Template Structure Updated

### Mental Status Examination (template-service.ts:58-63)

**Content Template:**
```
Appearance: ***
Behavior: ***
Eye Contact: ***
Speech: ***
Mood: ***
Affect: ***
Thought Process: ***
Thought Content: ***
Perceptual Disturbances: ***
Suicidal Ideation: ***
Homicidal Ideation: ***
Insight: ***
Judgment: ***
```

The `***` wildcards are filled by the AI based on the transcript.

### Assessment Section (template-service.ts:64-69)

**Content Template:**
```
Diagnostic Impression: @DIAGNOSIS@

Formulation: ***

Risk assessment: {Risk Level:304120111}
Prognosis: {Prognosis:304120112}
```

The formulation `***` is filled by the AI with a comprehensive case conceptualization.

## What the AI Will Do

### Mental Status Exam
1. Read the transcript
2. Extract observations about patient appearance, behavior, speech, etc.
3. Fill each MSE component on its own line
4. Follow the structured format exactly

### Assessment Formulation
1. Synthesize information from HPI, psychiatric history, MSE, and ROS
2. Create a narrative formulation that includes:
   - Patient demographics and presentation timeline
   - Symptom description and DSM criteria alignment
   - Triggering factors and course
   - Psychosocial context
   - Insight and motivation
   - Protective and risk factors
3. Output as a coherent paragraph

## Testing

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:3002

**Expected Output:**

### MSE (Structured, not paragraph)
```
Appearance: [description]
Behavior: [description]
Eye Contact: [description]
...
Judgment: [description]
```

### Assessment (With formulation)
```
Diagnostic Impression: [diagnoses with ICD codes]

Formulation: [Comprehensive paragraph synthesizing the case]

Risk assessment: [Low/Moderate/High]
Prognosis: [Good with treatment/Fair/Guarded/etc]
```

## Files Modified

| File | Section | Change |
|------|---------|--------|
| `services/note/src/templates/template-service.ts` | Line 58-63 | MSE structured format with 13 components |
| `services/note/src/templates/template-service.ts` | Line 64-69 | Added Formulation subsection with exemplar |

## Technical Details

### MSE Components (in order)
1. Appearance
2. Behavior
3. Eye Contact
4. Speech
5. Mood
6. Affect
7. Thought Process
8. Thought Content
9. Perceptual Disturbances
10. Suicidal Ideation
11. Homicidal Ideation
12. Insight
13. Judgment

### Formulation Guidance (from exemplar)
The AI is trained to include:
- Patient age and timeline ("This is a [age]-year-old patient presenting with a [duration] history of...")
- Core symptoms aligned with diagnosis
- Triggering or precipitating factors
- Psychosocial context (support, prior treatment, etc.)
- Comorbidities or secondary concerns
- Insight and motivation assessment
- Protective factors
- Risk factors (if applicable)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] MSE appears as structured list (not paragraph)
- [ ] Each MSE component on its own line
- [ ] Assessment includes "Formulation:" header
- [ ] Formulation is a comprehensive paragraph (not bullet points)
- [ ] Formulation synthesizes case appropriately
- [ ] Risk assessment and Prognosis still use SmartList values

## Next Steps

1. Generate a note with your test transcript
2. Verify MSE is structured (13 lines)
3. Verify Assessment has Formulation section
4. You can then refine the formulation style/content as needed
